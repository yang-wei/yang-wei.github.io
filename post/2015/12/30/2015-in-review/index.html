Being a student is really blissful. All you have to worry is to learn and feed yourself with knowledge everyday. Although I am not completely agree with Japanese education system but I had learn the most important thing in school - that is learning how to learn. In the next year (April 2016) I will start working in a Japanese IT company. Not sure what does working life is like but let&rsquo;s face it.</p><h3 id=thing-i-built>Thing I built</h3><p>2015 had been busy for me. There are 3 main projects which is worth mention or note down.</p><h4 id=1-tech-train>1. Tech-train</h4><p>Although not release publicly, developing a programming quiz system made me learn a lot. I even wroted down a <a href=http://yangweilim.com/blog/2015/07/24/lesson-learned-from-developing-large-web-application/>post</a> for this. Although this project ends up releasing privately, it was a great learning.</p><h4 id=2-react-d3httpsgithubcomesbullingtonreact-d3>2. <a href=https://github.com/esbullington/react-d3>react-d3</a></h4><p>This one need another post for itself but to summarize it up:
This is the first open source project which I had put in a lot of time. I had around 100 commits throughout the year and ends up being the maintainer currently. Maintaining an open source project is a lot harder than I think. Time and energy are needed as well as communication skill. Thanks to all open source maintainer around the world !!!</p><h4 id=3-traveehttptraveeco>3. <a href=http://travee.co>travee</a></h4><p>I join <a href=http://travee.co>travee</a> as intern in the October of 2015. Working in a startup is a lot different with big company(had worked for a few in part time). You decide what stack is good and you just use it. Development in travee had been crazy and excited. In around 2 months, I added a few new technology into the stacks(redis, node.js, webpack) on top of the original PHP web framework (not going to mention here because I think this one sucks). This had also be my most busiest month to keep up school work simultaneously.</p><h3 id=stack>Stack</h3><p>2015 has also been a very busy year for all JavaScript developer(I believe) because new framework/technology came out. It&rsquo;s not possible to learn or keep track all the thing but I am glad I picked up a few which is really great.</p><h4 id=vuejshttpvuejsorg><a href=http://vuejs.org>Vue.js</a></h4><p>Instead of <a href=https://facebook.github.io/react/>react</a> popularity, two third of my project had been using Vue.js. It hit 1.0 in 2015 and I adopted it into my project even before that. The greatest thing about Vue.js is simplicity. Low learning curve made all team members get productive quickly.</p><h4 id=redux>redux</h4><p>The concept introduced by Redux (developed by <a href=https://github.com/gaearon>Dan Abramov</a>) is the greatest thing I learned in 2015. Touching redux made me realise how declarative and simple is functional programming which lead me to the next exploration.</p><h4 id=elm>Elm</h4><p>Mentioned in <a href=https://github.com/rackt/redux#thanks>redux readme</a>, <a href=http://elm-lang.org/>Elm</a> becomes the 4th programming language (since fortran, PHP, JavaScript) I learned in my life. This was the hardest. It took me quite a long time to get familiar with its syntax, concept and everything. Type system, currying concept, immutability data structures, signal&mldr; the list goes on. I din&rsquo;t end up developing any thing with Elm but exposing myself to functional programming had widen myself as a programmer.</p><h4 id=clojure>Clojure</h4><p>Clojure had been mentioned a lot by twitter account I am following. When I start to learn FP, Elm and Clojure are my final options and I opted Elm because of too much parenthesess in Clojure. I had been doing <a href=http://4clojure.com>clojure exercise</a> for some time and I start to get use of it. Indeed I am really looking forward to create something with Clojure or ClojureScript.</p><h3 id=books>Books</h3><p>Below are some books I read(mostly complete) in the year.
Thanks to these great books, today I am a better programmer(capable of some devops haha):</p><ul><li><a href=https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate>Build APIs You Won&rsquo;t Hate</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide>Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming</a></li><li><a href=https://book.serversforhackers.com/>Servers for Hackers</a></li><li><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8677004-the-art-of-readable-code>The Art of Readable Code</a></li><li><a href=http://jstesting.jcoglan.com/>JavaScript Testing Recipes</a> &mdash; (reading)</li></ul><h3 id=life-lesson>Life lesson</h3><p>In short, I had learn to <strong>distrust</strong>. Everyday technology keeps popping out and it&rsquo;s impossible to keep track all the thing. At least until stable release, I would like to spend my time on something else instead of learning bleeding edge technology.</p><h3 id=2016-i-am-ready->2016, I am ready !</h3><pre><code> _____  _____  __    ____

</code></pre><p>I don&rsquo;t have 100% I will be writing JavaScript code when I start to work but I will still keep myself get updated and active in this community.</p><p>I really look forward into it and I in 2016 here&rsquo;s what I predict:</p><ul><li>JavaScript ecosystem will be more complicated and community start swifting to compiled-to-js language like ClojureScript or Elm</li><li>React(and its ecosystem) will best the most popular JS framework but Vue.js will grow bigger and has it&rsquo;s community</li><li>Functional Programming is going to be mainstream (especially front end !) - we will hear a lot of currying, monads &mldr;</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer></footer><div class=comments><div class=comments></div></div></article><div class=foot>&copy; 2019 - 2021 &#183;
