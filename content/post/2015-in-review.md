2015 is coming to the end, so I decided to sum up happenings and things I had learn in throughout this year related to programming.


### End of Student life

Indeed this will be the last year of my student life (until March 2016, 3 more months to go). Being a student is really blissful. All you have to worry is to learn and feed yourself with knowledge everyday. Although I am not completely agree with Japanese education system but I had learn the most important thing in school - that is learning how to learn. In the next year (April 2016) I will start working in a Japanese IT company. Not sure what does working life is like but let's face it.

### Thing I built

2015 had been busy for me. There are 3 main projects which is worth mention or note down.

#### 1. Tech-train

Although not release publicly, developing a programming quiz system made me learn a lot. I even wroted down a [post](http://yangweilim.com/blog/2015/07/24/lesson-learned-from-developing-large-web-application/) for this. Although this project ends up releasing privately, it was a great learning.

#### 2. [react-d3](https://github.com/esbullington/react-d3)

This one need another post for itself but to summarize it up:
This is the first open source project which I had put in a lot of time. I had around 100 commits throughout the year and ends up being the maintainer currently. Maintaining an open source project is a lot harder than I think. Time and energy are needed as well as communication skill. Thanks to all open source maintainer around the world !!!

#### 3. [travee](http://travee.co)

I join [travee](http://travee.co) as intern in the October of 2015. Working in a startup is a lot different with big company(had worked for a few in part time). You decide what stack is good and you just use it. Development in travee had been crazy and excited. In around 2 months, I added a few new technology into the stacks(redis, node.js, webpack) on top of the original PHP web framework (not going to mention here because I think this one sucks). This had also be my most busiest month to keep up school work simultaneously.

### Stack

2015 has also been a very busy year for all JavaScript developer(I believe) because new framework/technology came out. It's not possible to learn or keep track all the thing but I am glad I picked up a few which is really great.

#### [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org)
Instead of [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) popularity, two third of my project had been using Vue.js. It hit 1.0 in 2015 and I adopted it into my project even before that. The greatest thing about Vue.js is simplicity. Low learning curve made all team members get productive quickly.

#### redux
The concept introduced by Redux (developed by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)) is the greatest thing I learned in 2015. Touching redux made me realise how declarative and simple is functional programming which lead me to the next exploration.

#### Elm
Mentioned in [redux readme](https://github.com/rackt/redux#thanks), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) becomes the 4th programming language (since fortran, PHP, JavaScript) I learned in my life. This was the hardest. It took me quite a long time to get familiar with its syntax, concept and everything. Type system, currying concept, immutability data structures, signal... the list goes on. I din't end up developing any thing with Elm but exposing myself to functional programming had widen myself as a programmer.

#### Clojure
Clojure had been mentioned a lot by twitter account I am following. When I start to learn FP, Elm and Clojure are my final options and I opted Elm because of too much parenthesess in Clojure. I had been doing [clojure exercise](http://4clojure.com) for some time and I start to get use of it. Indeed I am really looking forward to create something with Clojure or ClojureScript.


### Books

Below are some books I read(mostly complete) in the year.
Thanks to these great books, today I am a better programmer(capable of some devops haha):
 
 * [Build APIs You Won't Hate](https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate)
 * [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)
 * [Servers for Hackers](https://book.serversforhackers.com/)
 * [The Art of Readable Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8677004-the-art-of-readable-code)
 * [JavaScript Testing Recipes](http://jstesting.jcoglan.com/) --- (reading)


### Life lesson

In short, I had learn to **distrust**. Everyday technology keeps popping out and it's impossible to keep track all the thing. At least until stable release, I would like to spend my time on something else instead of learning bleeding edge technology.

### 2016, I am ready !

```

I don't have 100% I will be writing JavaScript code when I start to work but I will still keep myself get updated and active in this community.

I really look forward into it and I in 2016 here's what I predict:

 * JavaScript ecosystem will be more complicated and community start swifting to compiled-to-js language like ClojureScript or Elm
 * React(and its ecosystem) will best the most popular JS framework but Vue.js will grow bigger and has it's community
 * Functional Programming is going to be mainstream (especially front end !) - we will hear a lot of currying, monads ...
