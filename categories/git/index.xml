I am back and would like to write down something I learned through both internships which I participated last month. One of the new thing I want to highlight is probably team developement flow on github. Before this, I was using github in my personal project like simplified and everything was easy. No issue, no pull request and no conflict !!! However, thing totally changes when there are multiple developers in the same project.</description></item></channel></rss>
